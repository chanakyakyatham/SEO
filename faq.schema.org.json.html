<!--When a JSON-LD document's top-level structure is an object that contains no other 
properties than @graph and optionally @context (properties that are not mapped to an IRI 
or a keyword are ignored), @graph is considered to express the otherwise implicit default graph. 
This mechanism can be useful when a number of nodes exist at the document's top level that 
share the same context, which is, e.g., the case when a document is flattened. The @graph 
keyword collects such nodes in an array and allows the use of a shared context.
